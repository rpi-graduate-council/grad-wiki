What special tax write-offs — and responsibilities — do graduate students have? 
Here are some [Tax tips](https://optimataxrelief.com/blog/tax-tips-for-grad-students/) before you begin.
# How to Prepare Your Grad Student Tax Return
All fellowship and assistantship stipends are considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and by the state of New York.
# US Citizens and Resident Aliens
Fellowship stipends do not generally have tax taken out at the time of payment and fellowship earnings will not be included in a W2 form. As such, if you received fellowship income for the entire calendar year you will not receive a W2 form from RPI. However, all students are expected to report these earnings as taxable income and it is the responsibility of the student to keep the necessary records. [IRS Publication 970](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-970), “Tax Benefits for Education,” explains how these amounts should be reported on your tax return. Graduate students may exclude from fellowship income spent for tuition and fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for courses. Tax treatment of specific items changes from year to year, so it’s important to visit the IRS website for the most recent regulations. It is a good idea to consider hiring a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to help with this process.
## Nonresident Aliens
RPI is required to withhold a s percentage in federal taxes and a percentage in state taxes from fellowship stipends, unless the student is eligible for exemption under a tax treaty.

## Graduate Student Assistantship Stipends
For graduate student assistantship stipends (those appointed to and RA or TA, positions), taxes are withheld at the time of payment and the stipend amount is reported to the IRS by RPI. 
## IRS
The [Internal Revenue Service](https://www.irs.gov/) (IRS) The IRS mission is to provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and to enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all.
#### IRS Statutory authority
