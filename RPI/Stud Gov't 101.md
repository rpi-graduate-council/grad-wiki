When people speak of the "Rensselaer Union", they may be referring to either the [student-run building](The%20Union.md) at the corner of of [Sage and 15th](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rensselaer+Union/@42.7299076,-73.679241,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89de0f9ff3c17227:0xd5d808a8e2c02a72!8m2!3d42.7299076!4d-73.6766661!16s%2Fg%2F11r922zdp?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkyNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), or the Student Government it houses. As the name suggests, **all of Stud Govt's voting members/leaders are RPI students**, either elected or appointed by RPI students.

The [Union Constitution](https://rpi.app.box.com/v/rpisg/file/1689369858823) document lays out the structure, below its...

## ...Stud Gov't Branches

### Student Senate

- **Seats**: 29 total, [elected](Stud%20Gov't%20101.md#Elections) by the RPI student body. 7 of the seats are allotted to the [Graduate Council](Graduate%20Council/GC%20Overview.md). 
- **Lead by**: The [Grand Marshal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Marshal_(RPI)), wearing a gender-neutral, cylinder top hat.

### Graduate Council
- **What**: Us. A.k.a _GC_; we are the "graduate legislative branch". Our purpose is graduate advocacy and programming.

### Undergraduate Council
- **What**: A.k.a. _UC_. Same name as Graduate Council, different structure/emphases. It is comprised of 4 _Class Councils_ (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior), with each having their Presidents.

- **Seats**: 6 voting + 5 alternative, appointed by J-Board Chair, approved by Senate.

## Elections
A.k.a. the [_GM Week_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Marshal_(RPI)#GM_Week_celebrations), take place in March. This is the time people become desperate to get a "GM Week Mug" -- a reward for casting your elections vote.
